## Planning using the ETMT at Diamond

The Instron Electro-Thermal Mechanical Testing System (ETMT) is stored at Diamond, either in the Harwell complex, or in experimental hutch 2 on the I12 beamline. The beamline scientists can crane the ETMT into position on the I12 beamline, as well as connect up the cabling and water supply. This includes connecting 3x analogue outputs, which can be used for synching data from the ETMT with the recorded sycnhrotron patterns.

However, the ETMT is not an easy to use equipment. The ETMT at Diamond is also slightly different to the one at Manchester. Therefore, it is advised to have at least one day of training with Andrew Pearce (Instron), followed by at least one/two days of practice experiments with your samples. 

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions with the ETMT at Diamond are needed to;

- Practice connecting the thermocouples. The samples at Diamond need to be tested in a chamber, which restricts the space to connect the thermocouples. For this reason, it is advised to have long thermocouple and resistivity wires (> 70 mm). It also helps to make the Pt/Rh (+ve terminal) wire slightly longer than the Pt (-ve terminal) for easy identification. Note, the Pt/Rh (+ve) wire also needs to be at the top of the sample, to prevent erroneous hot-spots forming along the sample length.  
- Create holders to support the thermocouple and resistivity connectors. If the connectors are pulling on the thermocouple wires, this is likely to pull them off during the experiment. So, use tape/metal objects to support the thermocouple connectors. It is also easier to insert the wires into the connector during the experiment if the connectors are upside down.
- Write out the methods. **Note, the methods cannot be copied from the Manchester ETMT software**. This can lead to errors in running the software and oupputting the data.
- Calibrate the PID settings. The PID settings for the

It is important to test the ETMT in advance of the synchrotron experiment.
