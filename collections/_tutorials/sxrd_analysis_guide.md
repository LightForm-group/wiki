## Synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis guide

### Flowchart for analysis packages

The following flow chart should be used to help guide your analysis of synchrotron data and to choose the analysis packages. The analysis packages should contain example notebooks, including example data, which can teach you about the principles of synchrotron diffraction data analysis. The notebooks are also based on text (YAML) file inputs, which should make the process of analysing data as simple as possible. Eventually the aim will be to remove as much of the interaction as possible so that the data can be automatically analysed. However, this automation is difficult due to the variety of different beamlines and different thermomechanical testers, and hence different datasets.
