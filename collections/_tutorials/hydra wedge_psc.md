# Tutorial for Hydrawedge plane strain compression tests

## Setting up the Gleeble Hydrawedge
### Turning on the Gleeble Hydrawedge
1)	Firstly, go to the control of the chiller/cooler. It should read “Stby”. Press and hold down the snowflake button until it displays the temperatures. 

2)	Pull down the lever on the mains switch for the Gleeble to turn it on.

8)	Switch on the PC and make sure it is connected to the Gleeble.

### Setting up the Gleeble Hydrawedge for experiments
1)	Take measurements of sample
