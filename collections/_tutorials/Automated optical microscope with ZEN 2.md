ZEISS Axio Imager 2 microscope offers couple of contrasting techniques for reflected light mode, which is used for imaging metal specimens: *Brightfield, Darkfield, 
Circular Differential Interference Contrast (C-DIC), Polarization Contrast and Polarization with Additional Lambda Plate*. Illustrative images for all of them are shown below.
For Ti and its alloys, the common way to reveal the microstructure is to prepare and etch the specimen in Kroll’s reagent and to use brightfield technique to look at it. 
However, microstructural details in Ti alloys can also be seen using polarized light, without etching. This is possible when the surfaces contain structures that alter the
state of polarization during the reflection process, which is the case for hexagonal α Ti, where individual grains in a polycrystalline sample reflect different light intensities
depending on their orientation. Most often polarization contrast is used for this purpose. Although, the C-DIC technique uses polarized light too, by using the Nomarksy prism
it reveals small differences on the surface of the specimen and therefore focuses more on the topography of the surface.
