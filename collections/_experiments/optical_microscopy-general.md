This describes two optical microscopes for looking at microstructures.

## Parameters to determine

### Fixed parameters
- Microsope - Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 with AxioCam MRc 5, Zeiss Axio Imager.M2m with Axiocam 305 Color
- Alloy elements (One or more of: Ti, Al, V etc.)
- Filter (Bright Field reflected, Dark Field reflected, Polarised reflected, Circularly polarised reflected)
- Sample Orientation Out of Plane (Z1) - (ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Sample Orientation Up, North (Y1) - (ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Sample Orientation Side, East (X1) - (ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Magnification - (2.5x, 5x, 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x)


### Adjustable parameters
- Material Description - (Text)
- Sample Processing Route - (Free text e.g. Rolling, Cast, Uniaxial Compression, Plane Strain, Tension, Forging)
- Optical Adjustments Applied (Free e.g shading correction, autobrightness)
