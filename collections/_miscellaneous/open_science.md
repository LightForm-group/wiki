# Open and reproducible Science

## Why share?

Sharing research is good for everyone. There are several reasons that sharing is for the good of everyone, it allows verification of research that has been done, decreases duplication which increases the amount of productive research which gets done and allows groups with fewer resources to still participate in productive research.

Sharing can also be good for the group that publishes the work. It increases the impact of the work by allowing more people to access it, it allows the development of collaborations with new researchers and groups from around the world and it also ensures that all researchers get credit for the work they do, not just PIs or grant holders.

## Barriers to sharing

Some people are concerned that if they share incomplete ideas or datasets then other people will steal them. While this is theoretically possible this rarely happens. If we ensure that there is an easy way for people to cite the work which is released, then people will likely cite it. As for people 'stealing' incomplete ideas and publishing them as their own, if the work is of any value then it would take a long time for others to reproduce the expertise of the publishing group in order to bring that work to publication.

Another barrier to publishing is lack of knowledge and lack of time. These are barriers that are now reducing as there are a greater number of resources now available to educate people about open research and also funders and PIs are putting a greater value and emphasis on sharing which means that we can afford to spend the time working on it.
