# Thermophysical Properties - Extended General

If you have JMatPro installed (congratulations for surviving that process) and have your alloy / composition in question loaded, you will be confronted by a vast array of calculations that can be applied to that alloy. This page is purely focussed on the "Thermo-Physical Properties, Extended General" tab, a tab which produces plots that show how properties for your alloy of choice will be affected by a change in temperature.

After clicking on the extended general tab, you will be greeted by three parameters you need to fill in, the heat treatment temperature, the upper limit and your step size. I'd like to address each parameter one by one, going from the simplest to the most complicated, while providing visuals to explain how each parameter will affect the data in the plots produced.
