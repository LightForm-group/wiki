# Matflow: An API for fully reproducible computational material science workflows
This page is intended to be the new place for all information on installing and reconfiguring matflow installations.

## Installing Python virtual environments

## Installing matflow-damask
Steps Ive done to install matflow-new with damask functionality on my CSF space:

Download this folder:
[matflow-new.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18733560/matflow-new.zip)

Create an environment of `python=3.10` using conda `conda create -n damask-venv python=3.10`

activate environment `conda activate damask-env`

install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Test matflow CLI works by just typing matflow in command line and pressing enter.

install `damask` and `damask-parse` `pip install damask==3.0.0a7.post0` `pip install damask-parse==0.2.30`  (NEED to be seperate commands because pip raises error if you try to do these together since 3.0.0a7.post0 isnâ€™t considered >3.0.0 )!

Download config files `.matflow-new/` and put this dir in home (`~/`).

Ensure `.matflow-new/config.yaml` file l12 is `/mnt/iusers01/jf01/<username>/.matflow-new/envs_CSF3.yaml` replace `<username>` with yours (mine is y15576gb) ex. `/mnt/iusers01/jf01/y15576gb/.matflow-new/envs_CSF3.yaml`

Point all `setup:` variables in `.matflow-new/envs_CSF3.yaml` to your newly created environment. (For example see how `envs_CSF3.yaml` given here all have `conda activate damask-env` .

Navigate to scratch and test by running lightest demo workflow `matflow demo-workflow go tension_DAMASK_Al`.

ABOVE ALL CHECK `damask==3.0.0a7.post0` and `damask-parse==0.2.30` with `pip list` !!!
