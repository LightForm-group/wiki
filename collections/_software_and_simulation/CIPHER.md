## CIPHER: Calphad Integrated Phase-field solvER

CIPHER is a parallel phase-field simulation code for microstructure evolution in multi-component alloy systems. It includes advanced features such as automatic parallel adaptive mesh refinement, local truncation error estimates and adaptive time stepping. CIPHER is designed for a large number of phases (10-10000), with computational complexity independent of the number of phases, and uses an efficient grand-canonical-based phase-field implementation with direct use of Compound-Energy- Formalism and other CALPHAD thermodynamic models for multi-component systems.
