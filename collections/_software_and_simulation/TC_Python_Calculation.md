#Setting up a Calculation

This section focuses on running a single equilibrium example using TC Python and PyCharm

#### Step 1: Open an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

On the remote Morton PC, an already installed and good IDE to use with TC Python is **PyCharm**

#### Step 2: Create a New Project

From the File menu in PyCharm, select New Project. The first time you create a new project, the IDE must be told use the base Anaconda environment, which where TC-Python has been installed. To do this, click on Project Interpreter and select Existing Interpreter. If this step is omitted, an error will occur when running a script: 'No module names tc-python'. This only required the first time the program is started. When creating the new project, name the project as appropriate.

#### Step 3: Create a Calculation File

Right click on the project just created and select New and then Python File. Name this file as appropriate and select OK. This is the document where you can write your calculation. The general structure of the calculation file as follows:

- Library Import: Calls libraries into the IDE
- Session: Establishes and maintains communication with the engine
- System: Loads elements and Thermo-Calc database(s)
- Calculator: Selects the calculator type e.g. single equilibrium, diffusion etc.
- Result: Result of calculation for post-processing
- Output: Shows your results as number, plot etc.

This page will go through each of these steps

#### Step 4: Library Import

Start my importing TC-Python by simply typing ```from tc_python import *```

#### Step 5: Session

This step establishes and maintains communication with the engine.

#### Step 6: System


#### Step 7: Calculator


#### Step 8: Result


#### Step 9: Output
