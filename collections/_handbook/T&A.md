All travel relating to University business (e.g. to a conference directly related to your research) must be booked through Key Travel wherever possible. 

Conference registration, travel and accommodation arrangements should be made well in advance and only following consultation with your Supervisor. 

An iproc requisition should be completed and submitted where applicable. 

Please do not make independent travel and accommodation arrangements with the expectation that they will later be reimbursed from University funds. 

Payments to Conferences/Suppliers not set up on Oracle:

Where on-line conference fees or, occasionally, travel need to be paid on the School credit card, please complete the One Off Payment form and return to Raj.Tandon@manchester.ac.uk 

Travel or conference arrangements etc must have written approval from either the budget holder or an authorised alternative before bookings can be made. This may be in the form of a completed paper requisition or an email.
