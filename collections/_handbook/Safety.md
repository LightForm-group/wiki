### Must read documentation

It is important that you read the School Safety Policy. Management System and Safety Personnel documents can be found on the School intranet [here](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/materials/health-and-safety/).

In addition, you must read the University safety policy which can be found [here](http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/DocuInfo.aspx?DocID=654).

### Mandatory training

You must attend the Health and Safety Induction and any specialised local safety training specified by your supervisor or the health and safety staff. 

There is detailed information in the Management System document ([here](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/materials/health-and-safety/forms/)) on the how to carry out Risk and COSHH assessments for laboratory based work. You need to update/revise your Risk and COSHH assessment forms annually when your work changes.

**Please note: No work can commence until a risk assessment and/or COSHH has been completed.

You must familiarise yourself with your laboratories and pay attention to all the safety documents relating to those areas. Safety equipment such as safety glasses, laboratory coats, gloves and hard hats will be issued as required and must be worn. 

For Postgraduate Students there are also Compulsory Health & Safety assessments on eProg.

The School safety policy and templates for risk assessments are available on the Virtual Common Room.

If you have any questions regarding health and safety, please contact your supervisor or the School Safety Advisor as detailed above.

### Keeping our team safe

We are committed to the implementation and maintenance of the highest standards of health, safety and welfare and we all have an important role in maintaining a healthy and safe environment.

Whilst on University business, it is your responsibility to take reasonable care of your own and others' safety by adopting safe working practices and making proper use of the safety facilities provided.

You can do this by complying with University Health and Safety Policies and Codes of Practice, which cover activities conducted within, or on behalf of the University. This applies not only on University premises, but anywhere else that you may be working.

We all have a duty of care in the workplace, therefore if you see anything that may be a health and safety breach and is likely to cause harm, you must speak up and report it to the appropriate health and safety officials immediately.

### Near misses

Reporting near misses is an important part of a safety culture. By reporting near misses (incidents that could have become accidents) we can learn and improve before any injury occurs. Near-misses are currently under-reported. You can report near misses informally to your supervisor and/or using the near miss reporting form. Be assured that all such reports will be treated as constructive help and the person reporting the near miss will not be blamed. The outcomes of a near miss will be used to improve safety for everyone, and will be treated anonymously. 

### Lone working

Lone working means working out of shouting distance of help. Lone working is covered by strict rules, and any high risk activity is prohibited from lone working. Avoid lone working whenever possible. Further details are available in the department safety documents.

### Out of hours work

Working outside core hours (9-6pm) requires an out of hours form to be completed and approved. A risk assessment must be completed for out of hours working. Note that this applies to both office and laboratory work. Out of hours working is discouraged, and not permitted for any high risk laboratory tasks (e.g. using chemicals). The department health and safety pages provide links to the necessary forms for out of hours working. If you are also using or leaving running some laboratory equipment out of hours, then this must have a equipment overnight permit. This permit has a section that must be attached to the equipment, giving details of the shutdown procedure in an accident (to be used by Estates or the fire service, for example).

### Safety is everyone's responsibility - if anything is unclear, speak to your supervisor or the safety officer
